# sandbox-interface

`sandbox-interface` is the provider-neutral contract for sandbox lifecycle,
files, processes, terminals, snapshots, private port ingress, and screen-stack
operations. Application services and provider adapters should share this crate
instead of depending on one another.

## Responsibilities

- Define stable consumer-owned IDs separately from opaque provider references.
- Define handled errors and async traits for sandbox services, backends,
  registries, and read-only access.
- Define bounded data types for file transfer, process output, terminal logs,
  image realization, ingress credentials, and screen viewport sizes.
- Provide mocks and a public conformance harness that every backend can run.
- Preserve provider-neutral lifecycle, reconciliation, and recovery semantics.

## What This Crate Does

`SandboxBackend` states what a concrete provider must implement.
`SandboxService` defines the higher-level lifecycle boundary used by a trusted
consumer. `SandboxBackendRegistry` selects an implementation by stable backend
ID, while `SandboxReadOnly` exposes a deliberately narrow inspection surface.

Consumer IDs are UUIDv7 values. Provider references remain opaque, so callers
cannot infer E2B or any future provider's identifier format. Bounded request
types reject unsafe paths, oversized commands and files, invalid ports, and
unsupported viewport dimensions before an adapter dispatches work.

The public `conformance` module exercises creation, recovery, image
realization, split-stream execution, private ingress, and terminal identity.
Adapters should run it alongside provider-specific transport and failure tests.
Image realization deliberately returns its source cleanup reference: callers
persist the completed image first, then destroy that source idempotently so a
cleanup retry cannot rerun build scripts.

## Quick Start

```rust
use sandbox_interface::{SandboxId, ScreenViewportSize};

let sandbox_id = SandboxId::new();
let viewport = ScreenViewportSize::new(1280, 720)?;

assert!(!sandbox_id.to_string().is_empty());
assert_eq!(viewport.width(), 1280);
# Ok::<(), sandbox_interface::Error>(())
```

## Development

```bash
cargo test -p sandbox-interface
cargo test -p sandbox-interface --test backend_conformance
cargo test -p sandbox-interface --test read_only_file_contract
cargo clippy -p sandbox-interface --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Key Code

- `src/backend.rs` — provider lifecycle and reconciliation obligations.
- `src/service.rs` — trusted consumer lifecycle boundary.
- `src/backend_files.rs` and `src/process_run.rs` — bounded file/process data.
- `src/read_only.rs` — narrow non-mutating capability.
- `src/screen_stack.rs` — screen capabilities and validated viewport values.
- `src/conformance.rs` — reusable backend conformance harness.
